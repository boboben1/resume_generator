The generator I used for my resume.

[wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) is required for this to run.

Run "NPM I" to install necessary dependencies. WKHTMLTOPDF needs to be installed separately if generating PDF.

To generate the resume, run "gulp" (REQUIRES wkhtmltopdf).

To generate just HTML, run "gulp html"
